# Beginner's Guide to Quantum Computing / Guide d'initiation à l'informatique quantique

This repository aims to provide resources and practical projects to support beginners in learning quantum computing. (So am I, a total beginner but be entusiastic in this field)

It covers fundamental concepts, practical applications, and hands-on coding exercises to build a solid foundation in the field.

Quantum Science could be divided into following areas:

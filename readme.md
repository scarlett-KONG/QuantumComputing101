# Beginner's Guide to Quantum Computing / Guide d'initiation à l'informatique quantique

This repository aims to provide resources and practical projects to support beginners in learning quantum computing. (So am I, a total beginner but be entusiastic in this field)

It covers fundamental concepts, practical applications, and hands-on coding exercises to build a solid foundation in the field.

The repository **is going to be organized** into the following sections:

1. Physics: An introduction to the essential physics concepts that underpin quantum computing, such as quantum mechanics and linear algebra.
2. Quantum Computer Science: A focus on the theoretical aspects of quantum computing, including quantum algorithms and complexity theory.
3. Quantum Information: An exploration of how information is represented and processed in quantum systems, with topics like qubits, entanglement, and quantum cryptography.
4. Hands-On Coding Projects: Practical coding exercises and projects to implement quantum algorithms using popular quantum computing frameworks, such as Qiskit or Cirq.

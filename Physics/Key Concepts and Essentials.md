# Key Concepts and Essentials

Understanding key concepts is crucial. 
It's not enough to just know their definitions. A professional student or researcher should be able to explain them in his own words, which demonstrate true mastery.

## 1. Coherence
Coherence expresses the potential for two waves to interfere. Two monochromatic beams from a single source always interfere. As the wave sources are not strictly mo,ochromatic: they may be partly coherent. Beams from different sources are mutually incoherent.

When interfering, two waves add together to create a wave of greater amplitude than either one (constructive interference) or subtract from each other to create a wave of minima which may be zero (destructive interference), depending on their relative phase.

Two waves with constant relative phase will be coherent.
